            Progressive Wave
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          A progressive wave is a type of wave that carries energy from one place to another through the periodic disturbance of a medium. It exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation and motion as it propagates. Here are some key points about progressive waves:

            Characteristics:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Progressive waves are characterized by their ability to transfer energy without transporting matter. The particles of the medium oscillate around their equilibrium positions as the wave passes through.
          </li>
          <li>
            They can be classified into two types: transverse waves, where the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, and longitudinal waves, where the particles oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Progressive waves exhibit properties such as wavelength, amplitude, frequency, and wave speed, which determine their behavior and characteristics.

        </ul>

            Propagation:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Progressive waves propagate through a medium by the successive oscillation and disturbance of particles.
          </li>
          <li>
            They follow the principle of superposition, meaning that when two or more waves meet, their displacements add up to form a resultant wave.
          </li>
          <li>
            The wavefront of a progressive wave represents the points in the medium that are in the same phase of oscillation at a given time.

            Examples:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An example of a transverse progressive wave is a water wave on the surface of a pond or ocean. As the wave travels, the particles of water move up and down in a perpendicular direction to the wave&lsquo;s motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            An example of a longitudinal progressive wave is a sound wave. In a sound wave, the particles of air oscillate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave, transmitting sound energy from the source to the receiver.
          </li>
          <li>
            Light waves are another example of transverse progressive waves that propagate through space, carrying electromagnetic energy and exhibiting wave-like properties.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Progressive waves are fundamental to our understanding of various natural phenomena, including sound, light, water waves, and seismic waves. They play a crucial role in communication, transportation, and the study of wave behavior in different mediums.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          A stationary wave, also known as a standing wave, is a wave pattern that appears to be standing still rather than propagating through space. It is formed by the interference of two waves of the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions. Unlike a progressive wave, which moves through space, a stationary wave oscillates in place.

          In a stationary wave, certain points called nodes and antinodes remain fixed. Nodes are points where the displacement is always zero, while antinodes are points of maximum displacement. The distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is half the wavelength of the wave.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Stationary waves have distinct modes or patterns of vibration, characterized by the number of nodes and antinodes present. These modes are determined by the boundary conditions of the system in which the wave is formed, such as the length of the medium or the presence of fixed boundaries.

          Stationary waves have various applications, including musical instruments, acoustic resonance, and electromagnetic waveguides. Understanding their properties and behavior is crucial in fields such as physics and engineering.
