            Quantum Nature of Radiation

        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The quantum nature of radiation is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that describes the behavior of electromagnetic radiation, such as light, as both waves and particles known as photons. This concept is based on several key principles:

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          According to the wave-particle duality principle, electromagnetic radiation can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This means that light can behave as a continuous wave with properties such as wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, as well as discrete particles  &#40;photons&#41; with energy and momentum.

          </span>
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Quantum theory states that energy is quantized, meaning it can only exist in discrete amounts called quanta. In the case of radiation, energy is carried by individual photons, and the energy of each photon is directly proportional to its frequency. This implies that light can only be emitted or absorbed in specific energy packets corresponding to the energy of individual photons.

        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The photoelectric effect, first explained by Albert Einstein, provided strong evidence for the particle-like nature of light. It is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when exposed to light of a certain frequency or above. The energy transfer in the photoelectric effect occurs in discrete quanta, with each photon transferring its energy to a single electron.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Another manifestation of the wave-particle duality is the ability of photons to interfere and diffract. Interference occurs when photons interact with each other and exhibit constructive or destructive interference patterns, similar to the interference of waves. Diffraction refers to the bending and spreading of light around obstacles or through narrow openings, indicating its wave-like behavior.

          Quantum electrodynamics  &#40;QED&#41; is the quantum field theory that describes the interaction of light and matter.

          In the photoelectric effect, the stopping potential refers to the minimum potential difference  &#40;voltage&#41; applied across a metal surface that can stop the flow of emitted electrons. When the stopping potential is reached, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons becomes zero, and they can no longer overcome the opposing electric field.

          The measurement of Planck&lsquo;s constant using the stopping potential and frequency involves plotting a graph of the stopping potential  &#40;V&#41; versus the frequency  &#40;ν&#41; of the incident light.

          The graph exhibits a linear relationship between the stopping potential and the frequency of the incident light.

          Experimental data is collected by gradually increasing the frequency of the incident light and measuring the corresponding stopping potential. The obtained data points are then plotted on a graph, and a linear regression analysis can be performed to determine the slope and y-intercept.
