                  Surface tension is a property of liquids that arises due to the cohesive forces between molecules at the surface of the liquid.

                  Consider a liquid in equilibrium, forming a free surface. Due to the cohesive forces between molecules, there is an inward net force acting on the liquid molecules at the surface.

              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  To derive the expression for surface tension, let&lsquo;s consider a hypothetical imaginary line drawn on the liquid surface, forming a loop or contour. We can assume this contour to be a rectangle with sides of length L and width dx.

                  The net force acting on the vertical sides of the rectangle is balanced by the surface tension force, and it can be approximated as:

                  Since F is the force acting on the rectangle, we can consider it as the force required to break the liquid surface. Hence, F is also equal to the force required to separate the liquid along the entire length L of the contour.

                      Nature of the liquid and solid: Different liquids and solids have different surface properties, which can influence the angle of contact. For example, liquids that exhibit strong adhesive forces with the solid tend to have a larger angle of contact, while those with weak adhesive forces have a smaller angle.
