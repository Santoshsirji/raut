        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Alpha particles are positively charged particles consisting of two protons and two neutrons, thus having a helium-4 nucleus. They are relatively large and heavy compared to other subatomic particles. Here are some key characteristics of alpha particles:

          <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
            Carbon dating is a method used to determine the age of ancient artifacts and fossils by analyzing the ratio of carbon isotopes in organic materials. It is based on the principle of radioactive decay of carbon-14  &#40;C-14&#41; in living organisms and its subsequent decrease over time.

            <li>
              C-14 is constantly produced in the upper atmosphere due to cosmic ray interactions with nitrogen atoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              When an organism dies, it no longer takes in new carbon-14, and the existing C-14 begins to decay at a   known rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              The half-life of C-14 is approximately 5730 years, which means that half of the C-14 in a sample will   decay in that time.
            </li>
            <li>
              By measuring the ratio of C-14 to stable carbon-12  &#40;C-12&#41; in a sample, the age of the sample can be   estimated.

            </li>
            <li>
              The accuracy of carbon dating decreases with older samples due to the decreasing amount of C-14 and the   presence of measurement uncertainties.

              Contamination of the sample with modern carbon can affect the accuracy of the dating results.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              X-rays: X-rays are widely used for diagnostic imaging to visualize bones and internal organs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Computed Tomography  &#40;CT&#41;: CT scans combine X-rays and computer technology to create detailed   cross-sectional images of the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Positron Emission Tomography  &#40;PET&#41;: PET scans use radioactive substances called radiotracers to visualize   metabolic activity in the body and detect diseases like cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography  &#40;SPECT&#41;: SPECT scans use gamma-emitting radiopharmaceuticals to   create 3D images of organs and tissues.

            <li>
              Radioactive Iodine Therapy: Radioactive iodine is used to treat thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism by   selectively destroying thyroid cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brachytherapy: Radioactive sources are placed directly into or near the tumor to deliver targeted   radiation treatment.

              Health Hazards of Nuclear Radiation
            </span>
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
            Nuclear radiation can pose health hazards if proper safety precautions are not followed. Here are some potential health hazards associated with nuclear radiation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ionizing Radiation: Nuclear radiation, particularly ionizing radiation, can damage living cells and   tissues, leading to acute or chronic health effects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Radiation Sickness: High doses of radiation can cause radiation sickness, characterized by symptoms like   nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and in severe cases, organ failure and death.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cancer: Prolonged exposure to radiation increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as   leukemia, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Genetic Effects: Radiation exposure can cause genetic mutations in reproductive cells, leading to   hereditary disorders in future generations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-Term Effects: Chronic exposure to low levels of radiation may increase the risk of developing   diseases over time, although the exact threshold and impact are still a subject of ongoing research.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
            To minimize the health hazards associated with nuclear radiation, strict radiation safety protocols are followed in medical settings. Radiation doses are carefully controlled and monitored, and shielding measures are employed to protect both patients and healthcare professionals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
            It&lsquo;s important to note that the benefits of medical uses of nuclear radiation generally outweigh the potential risks when used appropriately and under professional guidance.
