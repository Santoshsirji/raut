            Thermoelectric Effect
          </span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The thermoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon of generating an electric potential difference  &#40;voltage&#41; across a junction of two dissimilar materials when there is a temperature gradient applied to the junction. It is based on the principle of the Seebeck effect, which states that a temperature difference across a conductor or semiconductor creates a voltage difference.

              Seebeck Effect:
            </span>
            This effect generates a voltage difference when a temperature gradient is applied across a junction of two dissimilar materials. The voltage magnitude and polarity depend on the specific materials used and the temperature difference.

              Peltier Effect:
            </span>
            This effect is the reverse of the Seebeck effect. When an electric current flows through a junction of two dissimilar materials, it can either absorb or release heat at the junction, depending on the current direction. Peltier devices, based on this effect, are used for cooling or heating applications.

          The Peltier effect is a phenomenon in thermoelectricity where an electric current flowing through the junction of two dissimilar materials causes a temperature difference. It is the reverse of the Seebeck effect, which produces an electric potential difference when a temperature gradient is applied. The Peltier effect can be summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a current passes through the junction of two materials, heat is either absorbed or released at the junction, depending on the direction of the current.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the current flows from the higher temperature side to the lower temperature side, heat is absorbed at the junction, leading to cooling of the junction. This is known as the cooling or refrigeration mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the current flows from the lower temperature side to the higher temperature side, heat is released at the junction, resulting in heating of the junction. This is known as the heating mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            The amount of heat absorbed or released at the junction is proportional to the magnitude of the current flowing through it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cooling or heating effect can be enhanced by using multiple thermoelectric junctions in series, forming a Peltier module or cooler.

            Variation of Thermoelectric EMF with Temperature
          </span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The thermoelectric electromotive force  &#40;EMF&#41;, also known as the Seebeck coefficient, is a measure of the voltage generated across a thermoelectric material when a temperature gradient is applied. The EMF depends on the material properties and the temperature difference across the material.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The relationship between the thermoelectric EMF and temperature can be described by the following equation:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          E = αθ + 1/2βθ²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            E is the thermoelectric EMF or the voltage generated
          </li>
          <li>
            α is the linear coefficient of the Seebeck effect or the linear term
          </li>
          <li>
            β is the quadratic coefficient of the Seebeck effect or the quadratic term
          </li>
          <li>
            θ is the temperature difference across the material
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          This equation shows that the thermoelectric EMF is a linear function of the temperature difference  &#40;αθ term&#41; and a quadratic function of the temperature difference  &#40;1/2βθ² term&#41;.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          At low temperature differences, the linear term dominates, resulting in a nearly linear relationship between the EMF and temperature. However, as the temperature difference increases, the quadratic term becomes more significant, causing nonlinearity in the relationship.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Specific temperature points of interest in thermoelectric systems include the temperature of inversion and the neutral temperature, which can be determined based on the values of α and β.
