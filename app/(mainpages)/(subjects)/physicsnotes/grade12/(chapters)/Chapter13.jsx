        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector associated with an electromagnetic wave. It describes the direction in which the electric field oscillates as the wave propagates through space.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Light waves are transverse waves, which means that the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In an unpolarized light wave, the electric field vector can vibrate in any direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          When light undergoes polarization, the electric field vector is restricted to oscillate in a specific direction or plane. This results in a polarized light wave, where the electric field oscillates in a well-defined orientation.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The phenomenon of polarization occurs when light waves undergo certain interactions or pass through specific materials, resulting in the restriction of the electric field vector to oscillate in a specific direction or plane. This leads to the creation of polarized light with a well-defined orientation of the electric field.

            When unpolarized light passes through a polarizing material, such as a polarizer or Polaroid sheet, it selectively transmits light waves vibrating in a particular direction, while blocking or absorbing light waves vibrating in other perpendicular directions. This process results in the transmission of polarized light.

            When light reflects off a non-metallic surface, such as glass or water, at a specific angle known as the Brewster&lsquo;s angle, the reflected light becomes polarized parallel to the surface. This is due to the selective absorption and reflection of light waves with a specific polarization orientation.

            Certain materials, such as anisotropic crystals, exhibit birefringence, also known as double refraction. In these materials, light passing through them splits into two rays with different polarizations and refractive indices. This phenomenon occurs due to the difference in the speed of light propagation for different polarization directions.
