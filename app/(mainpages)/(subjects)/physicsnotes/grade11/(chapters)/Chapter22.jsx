          Capacitance is a property of a capacitor that quantifies its ability to store electric charge and energy in  an electric field. It is defined as the ratio of the electric charge &#40;Q&#41; stored on the capacitor to the  potential difference &#40;V&#41; across its terminals:

          A capacitor is an electronic component designed to store electric charge and energy. It consists of two  conductive plates separated by a dielectric material.
