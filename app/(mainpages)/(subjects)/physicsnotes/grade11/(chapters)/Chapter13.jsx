          An ideal gas is a theoretical concept used in physics and chemistry to model the behavior of gases under  certain conditions. It is an idealized system that follows the ideal gas law, which relates the pressure,  volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas.

          Energy: The particles have kinetic energy associated with their motion.

            Gas molecules have three translational degrees of freedom due to their ability to move in three dimensions.    Each degree of freedom contributes &#40;1/2&#41;kT to the total kinetic energy, where k is the Boltzmann constant    and T is the temperature.
