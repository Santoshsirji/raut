            Real Images

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          A real image is an image formed by the actual intersection of light rays. It is formed when light rays  converge at a specific location after passing through a lens or reflecting off a mirror. Real images can be  projected onto a screen and are formed on the opposite side of the lens or mirror compared to the object.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          A virtual image is an image that appears to be formed by the extension of light rays. It is formed when light  rays diverge and do not actually intersect. Virtual images cannot be projected onto a screen and are formed on  the same side of the lens or mirror as the object.

            Mirror Formula
          </span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The mirror formula is a mathematical equation that relates the object distance &#40;u&#41;, the image distance &#40;v&#41;,  and the focal length &#40;f&#41; of a mirror. It is used to determine the position and nature of the image formed by a  mirror.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The mirror formula can be stated as:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          1/f = 1/v - 1/u
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Where:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            f is the focal length of the mirror &#40;positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror&#41;.
          </li>
          <li>
            v is the image distance, which is positive for a real image and negative for a virtual image.
          </li>
          <li>
            u is the object distance, which is positive for an object placed in front of the mirror and negative for    an object behind the mirror.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The mirror formula is derived from the principles of mirror reflection and the thin lens formula. It provides  a quantitative relationship between the object distance, image distance, and focal length, allowing us to  calculate one parameter if the other two are known.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The mirror formula is a fundamental tool in understanding and analyzing the formation of images by mirrors.  It is widely used in optics and plays a crucial role in various applications, including designing optical  systems, determining magnification, and studying image formation.
