                  According to the principle of conservation of energy in mechanics, the total mechanical energy &#40;KE + PE&#41; of a  system remains constant as long as no external forces are acting on the system. This means that energy is  transferred between kinetic and potential forms but the total amount remains unchanged.

                  When calculating the work done by a force, it is important to determine whether the force is conservative or  non-conservative. For conservative forces, the work can be easily calculated using the potential energy  function. However, for non-conservative forces, the work must be calculated directly by considering the  displacement and the magnitude of the force along the displacement.
