                  Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is launched into the air and moves along a curved  path under the influence of gravity. The key characteristics of projectile motion are:
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  1. The object follows a curved trajectory or path.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  2. The only force acting on the object is gravity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  3. The motion can be analyzed independently in the horizontal &#40;x&#41; and vertical &#40;y&#41; directions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  4. The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion, while the vertical velocity changes due to  the influence of gravity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  5. The time of flight is the total time the object is in the air.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  6. The maximum height reached by the object is called the peak or apex.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  Example of Projectile Motion:
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  One common example of projectile motion is the motion of a ball thrown horizontally from a height. In this  scenario, the ball initially has an initial horizontal velocity but no initial vertical velocity. As the ball  moves forward horizontally, it also starts to fall vertically due to the force of gravity. The resulting  motion is a curved path known as a parabola.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  During the motion, the ball experiences the following:
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  - The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  - The vertical velocity increases downward due to the acceleration caused by gravity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  - The time of flight is determined by the vertical motion and depends on the initial height and the  acceleration due to gravity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  - The maximum height reached by the ball occurs at the midpoint of the motion, where the vertical velocity  becomes zero.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  Projectile motion has various applications in real-life scenarios, such as sports, fireworks, and artillery.  Understanding the principles of projectile motion helps in predicting the trajectory and range of projectiles.
