          The Big Bang theory is the prevailing scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe. It  suggests that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense singularity around 13.8 billion years ago and  has been expanding ever since.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Big Bang theory states that the universe started from a highly compact and dense state, often referred    to as a singularity, and has been expanding and cooling over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            This expansion resulted in the formation of matter and energy, the development of galaxies, stars, and    other celestial structures, and the ongoing expansion of space itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            The theory is supported by various pieces of evidence, including the observation of the cosmic microwave    background radiation, the abundance of light elements in the universe, and the redshift of distant galaxies.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Hubble&lsquo;s Law, formulated by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, describes the relationship between the distance to    a galaxy and its recession velocity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The law states that the recessional velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from an    observer.
          </li>
          <li>
            This relationship is expressed mathematically as v = H0d, where v is the recessional velocity, d is the    distance, and H0 is the Hubble constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hubble&lsquo;s Law implies that the universe is expanding uniformly, with distant galaxies moving away from us    at faster velocities compared to nearby galaxies.

          The expansion of the universe refers to the phenomenon where the space between galaxies and other celestial  objects is continuously increasing over time.

            Hubble&lsquo;s Law, formulated by Edwin Hubble, states that the recessional velocity of a galaxy is directly    proportional to its distance from an observer.

            The amount of redshift is directly related to the velocity at which a galaxy is moving away, providing    evidence for the expansion of the universe.

            This accelerated expansion is believed to be driven by a mysterious form of energy called dark energy,    which constitutes a significant portion of the universe&lsquo;s total energy density.

            Gravitational waves are generated by the acceleration or movement of massive objects with asymmetry, such    as binary star systems, merging black holes, or neutron stars.
          </li>
          <li>
            These events cause spacetime to ripple, propagating gravitational waves outward in all directions.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Gravitational waves are detected using specialized instruments called gravitational wave detectors, such    as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory &#40;LIGO&#41;.
          </li>
          <li>
            These detectors use laser beams and interferometry to measure minuscule changes in the lengths of two    perpendicular arms caused by passing gravitational waves.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Gravitational waves provide a new way to study the universe, allowing us to observe astronomical phenomena    and events that are otherwise invisible or difficult to detect.
          </li>
          <li>
            They have confirmed the existence of black holes and neutron stars, provided insights into their    properties and behavior, and offered evidence for the mergers of these objects.
