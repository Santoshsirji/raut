          Newton&lsquo;s Law of Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, describes the gravitational force between two  objects. According to this law, every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that  is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the  distance between their centers.

            Derivation:
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          We start with the formula for the gravitational force between two objects:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          F = G * &#40;m₁ * m₂&#41; / r²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two  objects, and r is the distance between them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          At the Earth&lsquo;s surface, the object is near the Earth&lsquo;s center, so r is approximately equal to the radius of  the Earth &#40;R&#41;. The force is given by:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          F₀ = G * &#40;m * M&#41; / R²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Where F₀ is the gravitational force at the Earth&lsquo;s surface, m is the mass of the object, and M is the mass of  the Earth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Now, let&lsquo;s consider an object at an altitude h above the Earth&lsquo;s surface. The distance between the object and  the Earth&lsquo;s center is now &#40;R + h&#41;. The force acting on the object is:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          F&lsquo; = G * &#40;m * M&#41; / &#40;R + h&#41;²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Since the object is at a greater distance from the Earth&lsquo;s center, the force is weaker compared to the force  at the Earth&lsquo;s surface.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          To find the effective acceleration due to gravity at the altitude h, we divide the force by the mass of the  object:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          g&lsquo; = F&lsquo; / m = G * M / &#40;R + h&#41;²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Now, we can express the effective acceleration due to gravity &#40;g&lsquo;&#41; in terms of the acceleration due to  gravity at the Earth&lsquo;s surface &#40;g₀&#41;:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          g&lsquo; = g₀ * &#40;R / &#40;R + h&#41;&#41;²
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Simplifying further, we get:
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          g&lsquo; = g₀ * &#40;1 - &#40;h / R&#41;&#41;
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          This formula shows the variation in &lsquo;g&lsquo; with altitude. As the altitude &#40;h&#41; increases, the value of &lsquo;g&lsquo;  decreases.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          Similarly, the variation of &lsquo;g&lsquo; with depth can be derived using similar principles, considering the  additional gravitational force exerted by the Earth&lsquo;s mass above.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          It&lsquo;s important to note that this derivation assumes a uniform Earth with a constant mass distribution. In  reality, the Earth&lsquo;s mass distribution is not uniform, leading to some deviations in the formula.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The derived formula provides a useful approximation for estimating the variation in &lsquo;g&lsquo; with altitude and  depth.

The center of mass is determined by the distribution of mass within the system and is a purely  geometric concept.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          In uniform gravitational fields, such as near the Earth&lsquo;s surface, the center of gravity coincides with the  center of mass. However, in non-uniform gravitational fields or in the presence of external forces, the center  of gravity and center of mass may not align.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          A geostationary satellite is a satellite that orbits the Earth at the same rate as the Earth&lsquo;s rotation,  resulting in the satellite appearing stationary from a fixed point on the Earth&lsquo;s surface. It is positioned at  an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers &#40;22,236 miles&#41; above the Earth&lsquo;s equator.

        <br />
        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          The GPS system operates on the principle of trilateration. A GPS receiver receives signals from multiple  satellites and measures the time it takes for the signals to reach the receiver. By knowing the speed of  light, the receiver can calculate the distance between itself and each satellite.

        <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
          By combining the distance measurements from multiple satellites, the GPS receiver can determine its precise  position using geometric calculations. The more satellites the receiver can receive signals from, the more  accurate the position determination becomes.
