                  In procedural programming, programs are organized around procedures or functions that contain a series of instructions to be executed in a specific order. The focus is on breaking down the program into smaller reusable functions, which are then called to perform specific tasks. Procedural programming emphasizes code reusability, modularity, and step-by-step execution of instructions.

              <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg mb-4">
                  Object-oriented programming &#40;OOP&#41; is a programming paradigm that provides a set of features and principles for organizing and structuring software. These features enable developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Here are some key features of OOP:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <span className="text-2xl saturate-150 font-semibold text-orange-600 mb-2">
                          1. Encapsulation:
                      </span>
                      Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods together into   a single unit called an object. Objects encapsulate data &#40;attributes&#41; and the operations &#40;methods&#41; that can be   performed on that data. Encapsulation provides data hiding and protects the internal state of an object,   allowing controlled access through well-defined interfaces.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                          2. Inheritance:
                      </span>
                      Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and   behavior from another class, referred to as the base or parent class. The derived or child class inherits the   attributes and methods of the parent class and can extend or modify them as needed. Inheritance promotes code   reuse, modularity, and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

                          3. Polymorphism:
                      </span>
                      Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects   of a common parent class. It enables objects to respond differently to the same message or method call, based   on their specific implementation. Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, extensibility, and modifiability.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                          4. Abstraction:
                      </span>
                      Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them   down into manageable and understandable components. In OOP, abstraction focuses on defining the essential   characteristics and behavior of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Abstract classes and interfaces   provide blueprints for creating objects and specifying their common properties and methods.

                          5. Modularity:
                      </span>
                      Modularity is the concept of dividing a program into independent and   self-contained modules or classes. Each module or class represents a specific functionality or component of   the overall system. Modularity enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability, as modules can be   developed, tested, and modified independently.
