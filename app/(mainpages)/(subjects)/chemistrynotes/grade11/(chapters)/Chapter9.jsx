          Ozone occurs naturally in the Earth&lsquo;s atmosphere, particularly in the ozone layer located in the stratosphere.        It forms when oxygen molecules (O₂) are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, causing them to        dissociate into individual oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can then react with other oxygen molecules to form        ozone.

          Ozone layer depletion refers to the thinning of the ozone layer in the stratosphere due to the release of        certain chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons.

Ozone layer depletion poses a threat to the Earth&lsquo;s ecosystems and increases the risk of harmful UV        radiation reaching the surface.
