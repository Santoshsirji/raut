                  The electronic theory of valency, also known as the electron-pair theory of valency, is a concept in chemistry        that explains the formation of chemical bonds and the determination of the valence (combining) capacity of atoms        based on their electronic structures.

                      The electronic theory of valency was proposed by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      According to this theory, atoms achieve stable electronic configurations by either gaining, losing, or  sharing electrons to attain a noble gas (stable) electron configuration.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom involved in bonding.

                  <li>
                      The valence electrons are represented as dots or crosses around the atomic symbol (Lewis symbol or electron  dot symbol).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Valency is determined by the number of electrons an atom needs to gain or lose to achieve a stable electron  configuration.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Atoms with one, two, or three valence electrons tend to lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration,  resulting in a positive valency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Atoms with five, six, or seven valence electrons tend to gain electrons to achieve a stable configuration,  resulting in a negative valency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Atoms with four valence electrons can either gain or lose electrons, depending on the specific elements and  their reactivity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Chemical bonding occurs when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. This can  result in the formation of covalent bonds or ionic bonds.

                  <li>
                      The electronic theory of valency provides a framework for understanding the formation of chemical compounds  and the prediction of the combining capacities of elements.

                  An electrovalent or ionic bond is a type of chemical bond formed between two atoms when there is a complete        transfer of electrons from one atom to another. This results in the formation of positively charged cations and        negatively charged anions, which are held together by electrostatic attraction.

                      An electrovalent bond typically forms between a metal atom (which tends to lose electrons) and a non-metal  atom (which tends to gain electrons).

                  <li>
                      The metal atom loses one or more electrons to achieve a stable, noble gas electron configuration, resulting  in the formation of a positively charged cation.

                  <li>
                      The transfer of electrons creates a strong electrostatic force of attraction between the oppositely charged  ions, leading to the formation of an ionic bond.

                  <li>

                  <li>
                      The formation of an electrovalent bond is driven by the desire of atoms to achieve a more stable electron  configuration.

                  <li>
                      The octet rule, which states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to attain a stable  configuration with eight valence electrons, is often observed in the formation of ionic compounds.

                  <li>
                      Electronegativity plays a role in determining the polarity of ionic bonds, with the more electronegative  atom attracting the shared electrons more strongly.

                      The VSEPR theory is based on the principle that electron pairs in the valence shell of an atom repel each  other and tend to adopt an arrangement that minimizes these repulsions.

                  <li>
                      According to the VSEPR theory, the shape of a molecule is determined by the total number of electron pairs  around the central atom, including both bonding pairs and lone pairs.

                  <li>
                      Electron pairs, whether bonding or lone pairs, are considered as regions of electron density that repel each  other and adopt a spatial arrangement that maximizes their separation.

                  <li>
                      The geometry of a molecule is determined by the arrangement of electron pairs around the central atom. The  most common geometries include linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral.

                  <li>
                      The bond angles in a molecule depend on the number and arrangement of electron pairs. The repulsion between  electron pairs determines the bond angles, with lone pairs exerting greater repulsion than bonding pairs.

                  Bond dipole moment is a measure of the polarity of a bond. It is the product of the bond length and the        difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms. A bond with a higher dipole moment indicates a greater        separation of charge and stronger polarity.

                  Van der Waals forces are a type of intermolecular force that exists between neutral atoms, molecules, or ions.

These temporary dipoles induce similar dipoles in        neighboring particles, leading to attractive forces. The strength of London dispersion forces increases with the        size and shape of the particles.
