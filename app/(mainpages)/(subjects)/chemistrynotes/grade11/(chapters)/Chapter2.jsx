                  Dalton&lsquo;s atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in the early 19th century, laid the foundation for our        understanding of atoms and their behavior. The key postulates of Dalton&lsquo;s atomic theory are:

                      All matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms.

                  <li>
                      Atoms of the same element are identical in their properties, while atoms of different elements are  different.

                  <li>
                      Atoms combine in fixed ratios to form compounds.

                  <li>
                      In chemical reactions, atoms are rearranged, but no atoms are created, destroyed, or changed into atoms of  another element.

                  The mole concept is a fundamental concept in chemistry that allows us to quantify and relate the amounts of        substances in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept of a mole, which is a unit used to measure the        amount of a substance. The mole is defined as the amount of a substance that contains the same number of        particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12, which is known as        Avogadro&lsquo;s number (6.022 Ã— 10^23).

                  The mole concept allows us to relate the mass of a substance to the number of moles it contains. The molar mass        of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance and is expressed in grams/mole. It can be calculated by        summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule or the formula unit of a compound. The relationship        between mass, moles, and molar mass is given by the equation:
