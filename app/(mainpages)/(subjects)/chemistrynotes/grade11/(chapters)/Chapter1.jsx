                    The molecular formula represents the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule of a compound. It        provides the specific ratio of atoms in the compound. For example, the molecular formula of glucose is C6H12O6,        which indicates that each molecule of glucose contains six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen        atoms.

For example, the empirical        formula of glucose (C6H12O6) is CH2O, as the ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms is 1:2:1.

                    Chemical change refers to a process in which one or more substances are transformed into new substances with        different chemical properties. During a chemical change, the arrangement of atoms in molecules or compounds is        altered, resulting in the formation of new chemical bonds and the breaking of existing bonds. Some common        examples of chemical changes include combustion, oxidation, and chemical reactions. Characteristics of a        chemical change include the formation of new substances, changes in color, production of gas, release or        absorption of energy (heat or light), and irreversibility.

                    A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. It uses chemical formulas and symbols        to describe the reactants, products, and their relative proportions in a balanced manner. A balanced chemical        equation shows the conservation of mass, meaning that the total number of atoms of each element is the same on        both sides of the equation. The reactants are written on the left side, separated by a plus sign (+), and the        products are written on the right side, separated by an arrow (→) indicating the direction of the reaction.        Coefficients are used to balance the equation by adjusting the number of molecules or moles of each substance        involved.
