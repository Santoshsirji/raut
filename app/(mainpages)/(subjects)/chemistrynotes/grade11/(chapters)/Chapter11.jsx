          Active transport is a vital process in cells that allows the movement of ions or molecules against their        concentration gradient. It requires the expenditure of energy to transport substances from an area of lower        concentration to an area of higher concentration. One important mechanism of active transport is through        cellular ion pumps. Two well-known examples of cellular ion pumps are the Na-K pump (primary active transport)        and the sodium-glucose pump (secondary active transport).

          Heavy metals can exert toxic effects on various organs and systems in the body. The specific effects depend on        the type of metal, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility. Some common effects of heavy metal        toxicity include:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Damage to the nervous system, leading to cognitive impairments, neurological disorders, and developmental  delays
          </li>
          <li>
            Damage to the kidneys, liver, and other organs
          </li>
          <li>
            Disruption of the endocrine system, affecting hormone balance and reproductive health
          </li>
          <li>
            Damage to the cardiovascular system, leading to heart problems
          </li>
          <li>
            Impairment of the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases
          </li>

          Preventing heavy metal toxicity involves minimizing exposure to these metals. This can be achieved through:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adopting proper safety measures in workplaces dealing with heavy metals
          </li>
          <li>
            Using protective equipment and clothing
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring safe disposal of electronic waste and batteries
          </li>
          <li>
            Drinking clean and safe water
          </li>
          <li>
            Eating a balanced diet with low heavy metal content
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoiding contaminated areas and reducing environmental pollution
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p className="sm:text-sm lg:text-lg text-sm mb-4">
          If heavy metal toxicity is suspected, medical intervention is necessary. Treatment may involve:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Chelation therapy: Using chelating agents to bind and remove heavy metals from the body
          </li>
          <li>
            Symptomatic treatment to manage specific health effects
          </li>
          <li>
            Supportive care to address complications and promote overall well-being
